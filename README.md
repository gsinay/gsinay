- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m gabriel, a mostly (for now) self-taught programmer. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full stack developing, all the way from the front to the back, and how to use that as a tool for finance, education and health, the holy trinity of economic development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and the Django webframe. 

All fun aside, I suck at introductions. Shoot me an email if you're interested :):
